To realize multi-level RDF data input, where the elements of the form are dependent on ontology extensions is complex task. As we have seen there are two individual programs, one on the client and one the server, is required to realize the functionality. Their main responsibility is to ensure the data the data flow from the input elements from the user into the database, and the other way around. These are defined in the code in a procedural way by handling data processing, substitution or query result grouping on the server, and on the client JSON object to the form element. This implementation as was addressed requires HTML, CSS, JS and on the server it requires FTL and Java routines. The utility of the implemented framework is able to define the two endpoint of the information flow, namely the form elements and the data scheme in a expressive, way and the developer does not have care about how the JavaScript and Java solves the flow between the elements. Therefore the low level details are hidden and development is accelerated and simplified.


We have seen that for advanced entry form more complex dataset is required then key-value pairs, becasue they consists of several sub parts. So this means data flow between the user and the database must contain multi dimensional data which required some processor algorithm. On the server side this is the multi triple, which allows the definition of the data scheme regarding the cardinalities between the objects in the data in scope. With this definition the server is prepared to process the data coming from the client, and data from the triple store on the other direction. On the client side then the element sub form adder is the one that allows the expression of form layout regarding the element. This element is the basis for the client to handle the multi dimensional data, and allow the creation of it for the user by offering the hierarchical form.


Further important part of the vocabulary that supposed to be emphasized is the different restriction triples. With these restriction it is possible to define the dependencies of selectors. But these selectors, dues to the subform adders they contain the options of the elements. Since the implemented JavaScript UI framework is capable of sending request to the server. In such ontological process and system description, nothing is hard coded into HTML, JavaScript or Java code, everything comes loaded from the triple store, regardless if it is class or instance. So they provide a description of the functionality of the form.
