\section{Expressivity of the framework}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Most of the problems of the project were solved by the higher level language 
	\item Thus the code of the application could be significantly reduced
	\item This enables a more concise and readable documentation, which is a really important issue by such open-source projects.
\end{itemize}


\section{Reduced amount of code}

\begin{itemize}
	\item As the configuration data is in the form of RDF triples as well, they could be added through web interfaces to accelerate the development.
	\item The most important advantage of the framework that the web application ontology can describe the input forms for itself. 
	\item Another utility that in such case not only the data can be exchanged between institutes using RDF data, but the application descriptor as well.
\end{itemize}
