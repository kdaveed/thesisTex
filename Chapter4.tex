\section{Elements of the vocabulary}

\subsection{Data definitions}

To understand the necessity of certain elements of the vocabulary, further details of web the applications have to be explained. In VIVO, the display of the existing and the creation of the new data happens in individual pages. The display is done by so-called profile pages, that show the information about one particular instance. As it was in section \ref{233}, the information is grouped by predicates, and each predicate field contains a link that can call the data input pages. The link contains three parameters, \textit{subjectUri}, \textit{predicateUri} and the \textit{rangeUri}.The \textit{subjectUri} hold the value of the instance on whose profile the link is, the \textit{predicateUri} is for the predicate, with which the new dataset is connected to the subject, and the \textit{rangeUri} is an optional paramater.

Figure \ref{411_1} shows the workflow of a data entry process. On the right profile page of a skeletal inventory can be seen, which lists the added skeletal elements. The profile page is configured that the \textit{rangeUri} parameter holds in the links the URI of the classes of  skull and vertebral column respectively. These parameters have to be considered by the form loading because they influences the options of the first selector which let the user add the skeletal sub sub division. So therefore it necessary to introduce a flag into the vocabulary that sign if a variable is coming with the HTTP request for the form loading, or with the JSON object after the submission.

Figure \ref{41_3} shows all the nodes types and their attributes. Above the \textit{mainInput} boolean flag, there is the variable name, which is required, and the constant value in case. There are three types of variable, the class, resource and literal. The literal variable itself denotes a string value and it has several subclasses for the other primitive types.

The other, more important is the modeling of the triples in the dataset. The vocabulary for triples has the purpose to express different constraint on the data scheme as well. Above the class \textit{Triple} and \textit{MultiTriple}, which were addressed in the end of the last chapter, there are two types of restriction triples. One for the classes and one for the instances. As we have seen in the description of the OWL ontologies, there are different types of restrictions can be defined. For this reason it should be possible to allow the definition of which restriction is used by the ontology, upon the entry form should operate. This can be expressed by the three boolean, types of the \textit{classRestrictionTriple}. Moreover the greedy boolean flag means that the SPARQL query that queries the ontology has to return not only the result class but their superclasses too. Finally the instance restriction triples as the name indicates, expresses constraints between instances on the form. The examples in the next section will make the usage of the vocabulary more clear.

\subsection{Form definition}

The class \textit{Form} acts like a container for the form elements. There are two main types of form elements, the literal field and the selector. The literal field do not have further subclasseses because its type, is defined through the type of the variable it represents. It would be a sort of over definition. This is the simples case where the form adopts to the data model.

The selector can refer both instances and classes. If it represent and instance, so it let the selection of an existing instance, then it is possible to define an \textit{InstanceViewer}. This feature allows to define a table with several columns. The utility is that the application can show more information about an instance than only the label in the selector field. Each column has a title and a number, and they refer to as well \textit{RDFNodes}, whose values they show in the entries.

The class \textit{SubformAdder} is the subclass of the selector, and has a relationship to the form with the predicate sub form. With this connection it is possible to define the sub form as new form instance. Moreover it has boolean flag, that allow to define a button add all should appear on, which adds all the possible subforms. This feature is useful be the skeletal subdivisions that contains much bones.

\section{Use-cases of the \textit{RDFBones} project}

The aim of this section is to show how it is possible to solve different problems with designed vocabulary. It covers the two main tasks of the project, the skeletal inventories and the study design execution. These two examples are sufficient to show the utility of the particular elements in the vocabulary and exemplify how their assembly can lead to a compact definition of complex web application problems.


\subsection{Skeletal Inventories}

Skeletal inventories were already addressed in section \ref{[331]}. Their goal is to define what kind of skeletal elements are present. In this part the creation of the primary skeletal inventories are discussed in more detail. This use-case addresses some additional challenges of the software, that were not mentioned yet.

The explanation starts with the illustration of the implemented interface, to show what the logic has to define. As it was mentioned in figure \ref{411_1}, the entry forms can have inputs. In this case the input is the class URI of the skeletal subdivision that has to be added with it sub subdivisions and bone organs.




Figure \figref{421_1} show the triple scheme representing the skeletal inventories. All the rectangle are representing instances. All of them will be newly created insted of the subjectUri, which comes as a main input. The arrows with double line depicts multi triples. Important to note that between the variable \textit{boneOrgan} and \textit{boneSegment} there is only a single triple (\textit{fma:regional\_part\_of}) this use-case is simplified version and only entire bone segments will be added.

But above the instances to be created the classes have to be represented in the model too. Figure \figref{422_1} is depicts the complete data model of the problem.

As we have seen that the 


In this image for the better readability the predicates are not denoted, but their value can be found in figure \figref{421_1}. Each instance (rectangles) is connected to the class variable (ellipses). The red dotted arrows indicates restriction statements.





The large three rectangles, that encompass set of triples are the graph, which are connecting to each other by means of multi triples. This is the structure which is followed by the form as well.
