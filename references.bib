	abstract = "The Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA), initially developed as an enhancement of the anatomical content of UMLS, is a domain ontology of the concepts and relationships that pertain to the structural organization of the human body. It encompasses the material objects from the molecular to the macroscopic levels that constitute the body and associates with them non-material entities (spaces, surfaces, lines, and points) required for describing structural relationships. The disciplined modeling approach employed for the development of the \{FMA\} relies on a set of declared principles, high level schemes, Aristotelian definitions and a frame-based authoring environment. We propose the \{FMA\} as a reference ontology in biomedical informatics for correlating different views of anatomy, aligning existing and emerging ontologies in bioinformatics ontologies and providing a structure-based template for representing biological functions.

	abstract = {
	This paper proposes a new technique for the high-level construction of
	type-safe web-oriented user interfaces.  Our approach is useful to
	equip applications processing structured data with interfaces to
	manipulate these data in an efficient and maintainable way.  The
	interfaces are web-based, i.e., the data can be manipulated with
	standard web browsers without any specific requirements on the client
	side.  In order to support type-safe user interfaces, i.e., interfaces
	where users can only input type-correct data (types can be standard
	types of a programming language as well as any computable predicate on
	the data), we propose a set of type-oriented building blocks from
	which interfaces for more complex types can be easily constructed.
	This technique leads to a very concise and maintainable implementation
	of web-based user interfaces.
	
	We show an implementation of this concept in the declarative
	multi-paradigm language Curry. In particular, its integrated
	functional and logic features are exploited to enable the
	high level of abstraction proposed in this paper.
