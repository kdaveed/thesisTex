\section{RDFBones Project}

The master thesis is written in the frame of the project called \textit{RDFBones}. The project is conducted by the \textit{Biological Anthropology} department of the \textit{Universit√§tsklinikum Freiburg}, and funded by the \textit{Deutsche Forschung Gemeinschaft} (DFG). The main idea of the project is to make possible the definition of the rules and steps of particular anthropological investigations in a machine-readable way. This is achieved by the development of a core ontology in Ontology Web Language (OWL), that describes the general scheme of the processes, while custom problems are defined by means of so-called ontology extensions. The extensions are represented by further ontological RDF statements, which has the advantage that a web application can programmed in generic way so that it adapts its interface to the various cases. During the project an open-source RDF data based web application framework, called VIVO, is adopted and developed.

\section{Goal of the thesis}

Creating data by web applications happens so through web pages. In our cases the user interface does not consist only of static data input fields (i.e textarea, checkbox), but dynamic elements for more complex cases. Through the user interaction with page a particular dataset is created, and it is sent to server where it is processed and stored in a database. This means within a web application there are two individual software agents communicating with each other. The idea of the thesis is to design a data model that is capable of expressing layout of the web user interface, and as well as the scheme of the dataset that has to be created, and develop general purpose application library both for the client and the server side, that operates based this high-level definition. By means of this approach, it is achieved that the various use-cases can be solved by creating a descriptor dataset of designed data model. The implemented software is integrated into the applied open-source RDF data based web application framework called VIVO.

\section{Thesis outline}

The second chapter contains the background information necessary to understand the problems the thesis aims to solve. The first two subsections handles the RDF data model and the ontologies applied in the project, while the third section is about the basics of the web applications and the VIVO framework. The third chapter presents the problem statement and the brief explanation of the scheme of the solution. The fourth chapter presents the elements of designed data model for the web application domain, and present how they can be used to solve data input problems of the \textit{RDFBones} project. The fifth chapter is dedicated to the discussion of the developed software framework. Its first section provides an overview about the main components of the software, while the second give deeper insight into implementation. The last, sixth chapter covers the conclusion and the evaluation of the achieved system, and present the further potential in the idea.
