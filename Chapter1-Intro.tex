\section{RDFBones Project}

The master thesis is written in the frame of the project called \textit{RDFBones}. The project is conducted by the Biological Anthropology department of the \textit{Universit√§tsklinikum Freiburg}, and funded by the \textit{Deutsche Forschung Gemeinschaft} (DFG). 
The goal of the project is to develop a data standard and web application to document research activity related to biological anthropology. Withing the project RDF data model is used, it has the advantage against relational data model that it is easier to extend. The idea is to develop a core ontology, which describes scheme of the investigations generally, and define so-called ontology extensions that describes the particular case. The task of the web application is adopt the web user interface to the extensions. In this way the developed system is applicable for various investigations. \cite{infrastructure}

\section{Goal of the thesis}



\section{Thesis outline}

The second chapter contains the background information, that is necessary to understand the problem the thesis aims to solve. The first two subsection handles the RDF data model and the ontologies applied in the project, while the third section is about the basics of the web applications.

The third chapter presents the problem statement. The first section discusses the scheme of the data that has to be created to document anthropological research, while the second section show what does it mean in terms of the web application programming. 

The fourth and the fifth chapter are describing the proposed solution for the problem. The fourth chapter outlines the higher-level modeling of the application, and fifth in turn describes the how the implemented framework can operate upon the declarative definition.

The last, sixth chapter covers the conclusion and the evaluation of the achieved system, and present the further potential in the idea. \figref{outline} illustrates the structure of the thesis, where the blue denotes the chapter with conceptual content, and the yellow in turn the ones with practical content.
